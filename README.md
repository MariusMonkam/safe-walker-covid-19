 The developement of the project just started.
 we are using on the frontend React and React-native , SQLite as database but this is just for the demo purpose  we will move to more secure database. We also use react-navigation to create the navigation.
 
To start the project run the following command and make sure you have ```node 10 LTS``` installed.

```npm install -g expo-cli```

Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "NameOfYourProject"

```javascript 
expo init NameOfYourProjet

cd NameOfYourProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start
```
To create your navigation with react-navigation follow this [guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started)
